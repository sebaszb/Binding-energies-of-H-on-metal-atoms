prediction of H binding energies on metal atoms 

The binding energy of H on metal atoms is an important descriptor of the catalitic activity (Hydrogen evolution reaction). Based on the paper "A universal principle for a rational design of single-atom electrocatalysts, Nature Catalysisvolume 1, pages339â€“348 (2018)" the code predicts the binding energy of H on D metals based only on the number of d electrons and electronegativy  of the 3d metals (Sc, Ti, V...). It is a simple linear regresion.

The file train.csv is the training data, and the file test.csv contains the info of all the transition metals.
